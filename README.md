## Description

The goal of this repository is to develop an optimization method for intermodal contrainer transportation through highway, railway, and waterway networks. The transportation and transshipment of standardized intermodal containers are considered, as well as teh design of vehicle-specific services, including locomotives and barge ships. US-wide operations are modeled through GIS data.


## Python Prerequisite

The following Python libraries are required to run the source codes:
1. `numpy`;
2. `scipy`;
3. `pickle`;
4. `pandas`;
5. `networkx`;
6. `gurobipy`.


## Usage

The [data](data) folder contains collected intermodal data of highway, railway, and waterway nodes. Literature and model description are in the [docs](docs) folder. Python codes for the model is in the [scripts](scripts) folder.
